# Super gross OpenGL experiments

Welcome to my super gross code from a little while back when I went all gungho and thought I'd conquer OpenGL. Couldn't even get to 3d stuff:(. But made a halfway working fluid sim with velocity vectors at grid points (geometry shaders amirite). Look:

I intend to do "something" along these lines again, but without relying on Qt. Something like Dear ImGui + CMakeLists.
